### Agile Development Tool

Agile methodology is a project management approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress towards a well-defined goal. It is particularly effective in software development where requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams. Agile methodologies aim to deliver small, incremental changes in a product to improve quality and adaptability to changing needs.

#### MoSCoW Prioritization

The MoSCoW prioritization technique is used to determine the importance of various features and tasks in a project. This method categorizes features into four groups: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have. This helps in effective time management and ensures that the most critical functionalities are delivered first.

#### GitHub Projects

Using GitHub Projects, tasks are managed and progress tracked through project boards. Each board represents status of the User Story (To Do, In Progress, Done, Future features). Issue labels include the user, prioritization and iterations (milestones).

## UX design

The original layouts look different from the finished blog as some changes were made during the development process.

### Structure & Logical Flow

The database schema outlines the structure and relationships between key tables for the platform. The User table stores basic user information and authentication details. The Profile table extend user details with bio and profile image. The Post table manages user-generated content with fields for title, description, content, author, and metadata. The Comment table handles comments on posts, including author information. These tables are designed to ensure efficient data management and robust user interactions on the platform.

The database model diagram was designed using Lucidchart:

![Screenshot of flowchart](./README-images/database-erd.png)

### Colour Scheme

The colours were mostly taken from bootstrap colour palette. They are:
- `#212529` - text colour for post, comment, buttons; outline and hover effects on buttons
- `#FFFFFF` - background colour for post, modal; text colour for buttons when hovered over
- `#212529BF` - text colour for secondary text in post, comment
- `#21252908` - background colour for secondary text on the post card
- `#e9ecef` - background colour for comment that is waiting for approval
- `#dc3545` - text colour for X icon used for deleting the comment; text colour and border colour for confirm button when deleting post or comment; background colour for confirm button when hovered over
- `#f6f6f6` - background colour for header, footer
- `#86b7fe` - border colour and shadow for input when focused on it
- `#f8f9fa` - background colour for text messages ("No posts yet", "No comments yet"), buttons; text colour for welcome text on the home page
- `#000000` - text colour for active navigation menu item
- `#d1e7dd` - background colour for message
- `#0a3622` - text colour for message 
- `#a3cfbb` - border colour for message
- `#00000040` - background colour for login, signup forms
- `#00000080` - background colour for welcome text on the home page

Custom colours:
- `#e99767` - border accent colour for post title; circle colour for unordered list item's marker
- `#592c12` - text colour for navigation menu items
- `#f2d9cb` - background colour for main content
- `#5f4e2a` - border colour for active navigation menu item

![Custom colour palette](./README-images/colour-palette.jpeg)

### Fonts

- 'Playfair Display' (backup 'serif') was used as a main title font. It looks nice for titles and subtitles for posts.
- 'Halant' (backup 'serif') was used as a sub-title font. It was rarely used but it also looks nice with the other two fonts.
- 'Roboto' (backup 'serif') was used as a main text font. It is easy to read even if the text is small.

![Fonts](./README-images/fonts.png)


### Responsiveness

The website is responsive to different layouts depending on the size of the viewport based on the Bootstrap media queries.

![media queries](./README-images/media-queries.png)


## Security Measures and Protective Design

### User Authentication

- Django's LoginRequiredMixin is used to ensure that any requests to access secure pages by non-authenticated users are redirected to the login page.
- Django's UserPassesTestMixin is used to limit access based on certain permissions, ensuring users can only edit/delete content they authored. If the user doesn't pass the test, they are shown an HTTP 403 Forbidden error.

### Password Management

- Use Django's built-in password management tools to ensure passwords are hashed and stored securely.
- Enforce strong password policies to enhance user account security.

### Form Validation

- If incorrect or empty data is added to a form, the form won't submit, and a warning will appear to the user informing them which field raised the error.

### Database Security

- The database URL and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database. This setup was implemented before the first push to GitHub.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens are used on all forms throughout the site to enhance security.

Testing summary and results can be found in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.


## Deployment

### To deploy the project to Heroku

Follow these steps to deploy your Django project to Heroku from VS Code:
| |
| --- |
| **Step 1** Create a New Heroku App |
| - Access the Heroku Dashboard: Log in to your Heroku account and access the dashboard. |
| - Create a New App: Click on the New button in the top-right corner of the dashboard and select Create new app from the dropdown menu. |
| - App Name and Region: Enter a unique name for your app and choose a region closest to you (EU or USA). Click Create App to create the app. |
| **Step 2** Configure Environment Variables |
| - Reveal Config Vars: From the new app Settings, click Reveal Config Vars. |
| - Set Environment Variables: Set your environment variables as follows: |
|   - `CLOUDINARY_URL`: Insert your own Cloudinary API key here. |
|   - `DATABASE_URL`: Insert your own ElephantSQL database URL here. |
|   - `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC`: Set to 1 for temporary purposes, and remove it for the final deployment. |
|   - `SECRET_KEY`: This can be any random secret key. |
| **Step 3** Prepare the Project for Deployment |
| - Create a `requirements.txt` File: This file lists all the dependencies required by your project. You can install the project's requirements using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. If you have your own packages installed, update the `requirements.txt` file using `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`. |
| - Create a `Procfile`: This file specifies the commands Heroku should run to start your app. Create the Procfile using `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`. Replace `app_name` with the name of your primary Django app, which is the folder where `settings.py` is located. |
| **Step 4** Connect Your GitHub Repository to Heroku |
| - Automatic Deployment: Select Automatic Deployment from the Heroku app settings to automatically deploy your app whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository. |
| - Manual Deployment: Alternatively, you can connect your GitHub repository to Heroku manually using the Terminal/CLI: |
|   - Login to Heroku: Run `heroku login -i` to log in to your Heroku account. |
|   - Set the Remote for Heroku: Run `heroku git:remote -a app_name` to set the remote for Heroku. Replace `app_name` with your app name. |
|   - Push to Heroku: After performing the standard Git add, commit, and push to GitHub, you can now type `git push heroku main` to deploy your app. |
| **Step 5**  Verify Your Deployment |
| - Open App: Once your app is deployed, you can open it by clicking on the Open App button in the Heroku dashboard. This will open your app in a web browser. |
| - Verify App: Verify that your app is running correctly by checking for any errors or issues. |
